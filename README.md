## Installation :computer:

You are able to check this app by two ways:

 1. If you want to check a video of the functionality of the app, you can go to this URL: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IkUFSgyw0KmJJ_YRdgSe5gWlImhIEvTu/view 
 2. If you want to try it yourself, you have run the code down below.

## Usage :bar_chart:

If you want to try the app yourself make sure you have "Node.js" in your computer, and do not forget to run the next lines of code to start the app:
